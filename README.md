This is a compiler built for the OOP language decaf (in Fall 2014). It contains the following conponents:

- Scanner: define and extract lexical units (tokens) by using Regex and Flex.
- Parser: produce a parse tree by using Bison
- Semantic Analyzer: check any violation of semantic rules and output an annotated parse tree
- MIPS assembly code generator: generates code to be executed on the SPIM simulator
