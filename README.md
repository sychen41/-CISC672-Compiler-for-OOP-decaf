(Course: Advanced Topics In Artificial Intelligence(2016S) Project 1 &amp; 2
 
Project 1
 
- Used depth-first search to randomize a validated configuration for the input amino acid sequence and computed its corresponding energy.
 
- Implemented the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the ensemble of configuration obeying Boltzmann distribution.
 
- Implemented a genetic algorithm with simulated annealing to find the lowest energy configuration.
 
Project 2
 
- Reconstructed gene regulatory network from gene expression data(training data) by implementing Bayesian Network
 
- Implemented the learning algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood by generating conditional probability table (CPT) for each BN.
 
- Made inference about the expression level of a gene given the expression levels of other genes. Achieved prediction accuracy of .75.
