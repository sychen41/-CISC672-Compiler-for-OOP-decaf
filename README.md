# Compiler for OOP decaf (Fall 2014)
(Course: CISC672 Compiler Construction )
This is a compiler built for the OOP language decaf. It contains the following conponents:

- Scanner: define and extract lexical units (tokens) by using Regex and Flex.
- Parser: produce a parse tree by using Bison
- Semantic Analyzer: check any violation of semantic rules and output an annotated parse tree
- MIPS assembly code generator: generates code to be executed on the SPIM simulator

# Gene Expression Inference (Spring 2016)
(Course: CISC889 Advanced Topics In Artificial Intelligence
Project 1
 
- Used depth-first search to randomize a validated configuration for the input amino acid sequence and computed its corresponding energy.
 
- Implemented the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the ensemble of configuration obeying Boltzmann distribution.
 
- Implemented a genetic algorithm with simulated annealing to find the lowest energy configuration.
 
Project 2
 
- Reconstructed gene regulatory network from gene expression data(training data) by implementing Bayesian Network
 
- Implemented the learning algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood by generating conditional probability table (CPT) for each BN.
 
- Made inference about the expression level of a gene given the expression levels of other genes. Achieved prediction accuracy of .75.
