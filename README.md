This is a web application done in April 2014 for CISC474 (Advanced Web Tech)

Use PHP and the Slim framework to build out the application. 
The application can do the following:
1. Validate the user login off of the provided database
2. Using the Session (or the built-in cookie from Slim), persist that user login and provide them a way to log out.
3. After a user has logged in, show them a list of all 'Projects' you have.
4. Allow the user to 'review' the project with a number rating and leave a paragraph of feedback.
5. From the list of projects, show the user which ones they have already reviewed and what they said.
6. Show what other users have said and their review. Add an 'average' review to the top of the project.
7. Change password system to encrypt passwords (md5)
8 Show a list (similar to the user list) of all of their documents and allow sorting / paging.
9. Allow the user to click a document to review and edit the document.
Add another panel for administrators to view all documents that need to be 'approved'.
10. Allow administrator to view any document and mark them as approved.
11. Allow user to see documents that have been approved in their list.
