1.	What does it do?

This program implements the “knowledge base about diet food for certain common diseases” system.  It asks for user input about whether he/she has some common diseases, then it uses forward chaining to infer the recommended food list for the user (first query type), or it uses backward chaining to tell the user if some specific food that the user is interested in is good for him/her or not (second query type).

2.	How to run it?

This program is built upon python 3.5. So please download the right version from: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
Once installed, open the ks.py file using IDLE, and click the “Run” from the top menu.
